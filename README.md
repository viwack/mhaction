**The Project**
In collaboration with MHAction, Ginsberg's Community Technical Assistance Collaborative (CTAC) developed an innovative web-based mapping application that visualizes manufactured housing communities (MHCs) across Michigan. The project aim was to create an accessible tool that could assist in the organization’s advocacy for affordable and quality manufactured housing, and to bolster their broader campaigns for racial and economic justice.

**What We Created**
Under this partnership, we designed and coded an interactive mapping web tool, accompanied by a comprehensive data use guide. The tool visualizes data on MHCs, allowing users to zoom in on specific legislative districts, explore detailed community information, and generate site data in table form. Built on the RShiny framework, the tool integrates data sources from the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) and MHVillage, ensuring data is both accurate and up-to-date. The guide provides step-by-step instructions for using the tool, including data updates and running the application locally.

**Impact for Our Community Partner**
By providing a user-friendly platform for visualizing MHC data, we aim to empower MHAction and its community of residents to more effectively advocate for their rights. This tool has enabled and supported MHAction in highlighting regions of interest in their meetings with legislators. Furthermore, the infographics and website offer a visually compelling, publicly accessible way to communicate housing issues to a broader audience. One of our community partners, Deb Campbell, shared “The outcome from our partnership exceeded my expectations. The ability to present immediate visualization of manufactured housing communities, households and occupants by Michigan Legislative Districts (both house and senate) as well as county is a gamechanger for our Consumer Advocacy group. The heat map is a wonderful tool, and the related infographic is the icing on the cake.” 

**Key Takeaways from our Student Consultant**
Through this project, we've learned the importance of making complex data accessible, useful, and actionable for community partners. The iterative development process, involving feedback from MHAction, has underscored the value of collaboration in creating tools that are both practical and impactful. Additionally, ensuring that our tools are adaptable and easy to update for MHAction on a national stage will be crucial in maintaining its relevance over time.
